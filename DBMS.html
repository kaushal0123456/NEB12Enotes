      <section id="database-models">
        <h2>Types of Database Models</h2>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            The Hierarchical Model was the first database management system model. This concept uses a hierarchical tree structure to organise the data. The hierarchy begins at the root, which contains root data, and then grows into a tree as child nodes are added to the parent node. This model accurately depicts several real-world relationships such as food recipes, website sitemaps, and so on.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Network Model:</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            The network model in DBMS is better than the hierarchical model as there are more interrelations between entities. Supports various relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many as well. An entity can have various parents or owners. The connected structure results in high performance.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Relational Model:</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            Stores data in tables (relations) with rows and columns, using keys to define relationships between tables.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            A conceptual design model that uses entities, attributes, and relationships to map the data and its interconnections, primarily used during database design.

        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Referential Integrity:</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            Ensures that a foreign key in one table either matches a primary key in another table or is null, preserving relationships between tables.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Keys:</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            Fields designated to uniquely identify records and link data across tables (Primary, Foreign, Candidate Keys).

      <section id="normalization">
        <h2>Normalization</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Normalization is the process of structuring a database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity by organizing fields and table relationships logically.
        </p>

        <h3>Normal Forms</h3>
        <div class="question">
          <strong>First Normal Form (1NF):</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            Ensures each field contains atomic values and that records are unique.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Second Normal Form (2NF):</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            Achieved when the database is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <strong>Third Normal Form (3NF):</strong>
          <div class="answer">
            Achieved when the database is in 2NF and all attributes depend only on the primary key, eliminating transitive dependencies.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimizes data duplication and redundancy.</li>
