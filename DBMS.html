          <h2>What is Data?</h2>
          <p>
            Data consists of raw, unprocessed facts, figures, or symbols
            collected from various sources. It represents values or observations
            that, in isolation, may lack meaning.
          </p>
          <div class="example">
            Example:</strong> A series of numbers such as
            <code>85, 90, 78</code> representing student scores before any
            analysis.

        <section id="information">
          <h2>What is Information?</h2>
          <p>
            Information is data that has been processed, organized, or
            structured to provide context and meaning. It transforms raw data
            into a useful and interpretable form that supports decision-making.
          </p>
          <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Calculating "The average score of the
            class is 84.3" provides insight derived from the raw student scores.

          <h2>Types of Database Models</h2>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The Hierarchical Model organizes data in a tree-like structure,
              where each record has a single parent and possibly many children.
              It mimics a hierarchy, such as folders within a file system. The
              topmost node is called the root, and subsequent levels are child
              nodes. This model is efficient for operations with predictable
              parent-child relationships. However, it lacks flexibility for
              representing many-to-many relationships and requires traversal
              from the root to access any data.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Network Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The Network Model extends the hierarchical model by allowing each
              child to have multiple parents. It uses a graph structure with
              records connected through links. This model supports complex
              relationships like many-to-many, improving data access speed.
              However, it also increases design complexity and is less intuitive
              to implement compared to newer models.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Relational Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The Relational Model is the most widely used model. It stores data
              in tables (relations), where each table consists of rows (records)
              and columns (attributes). Relationships between tables are
              established using keys such as primary keys and foreign keys. This
              model is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and support for
              powerful querying through SQL. It promotes data integrity and
              reduces redundancy through normalization.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The ER Model is a high-level conceptual data model used primarily
              in database design. It represents real-world entities (such as
              students, courses) and their relationships (enrollment,
              registration). Entities have attributes (e.g., student name, ID),
              and relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
              It helps in visualizing data before converting it into relational
              schemas.

            <div class="answer">
              Ensures that each attribute value falls within a specific set of
              valid data values. For example, the age field should accept only

            <strong>Entity Integrity:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              Requires that each table has a primary key and that this key is
              unique and non-null for every record. It ensures that each entity

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Referential Integrity:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              Ensures consistency among rows in related tables. A foreign key in
              one table must match a primary key in another table or be null.

          <h2>Normalization</h2>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Normalization is a systematic approach to organizing data in a
            database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It
            involves dividing large tables into smaller, related ones and
            defining relationships using keys.
          </p>

          <h3>Normal Forms</h3>
          <div class="question">
            <strong>First Normal Form (1NF):</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              A table is in 1NF if:
              <ul>
                <li>All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values.</li>
                <li>Each record is unique and identified by a primary key.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Second Normal Form (2NF):</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              Achieved when:
              <ul>
                <li>The table is in 1NF.</li>
                <li>
                  All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire
                  primary key (i.e., no partial dependencies).
                </li>
              </ul>

                <li>
                  There are no transitive dependencies (i.e., non-key attributes

            <h3>Advantages of Normalization</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reduction of Data Redundancy:</strong> Normalization
                helps eliminate duplicate data within the database by organizing
                tables such that each fact is stored only once. This reduces the
                amount of storage required and minimizes inconsistencies that
                arise when the same data is updated in multiple places.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved Data Integrity:</strong> By enforcing
                relationships through keys and dependencies, normalization
                ensures that the data remains accurate and consistent. For
                example, updating a value in one place automatically reflects
                correctly across all related tables.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Easier Database Maintenance:</strong> Since data is
                well-structured and logically organized, it becomes easier for
                database administrators and developers to maintain and update
                the database. Changes to the database schema or data itself are
                less error-prone and simpler to implement.

              <li>
                <strong>Efficient Storage Utilization:</strong> Normalized
                databases minimize wasted space by avoiding unnecessary
                repetition of data. This leads to more efficient use of disk
                space and can improve overall system performance.

              <li>
                <strong>Avoidance of Anomalies:</strong> Normalization helps
                prevent common data anomalies such as insertion anomalies (where
                you cannot insert data due to missing related data), update
                anomalies (where some data gets updated but other copies remain
                outdated), and deletion anomalies (where deleting data
                unintentionally removes important related data).

            <h3>Disadvantages of Normalization</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Complex Queries:</strong> Highly normalized databases
                often require joining many tables to retrieve related data,
                which can make queries more complex and harder to write or
                understand. This can slow down the development process for
                complex reports or data retrieval.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance Overhead:</strong> Because of the need for
                multiple joins between tables, normalized databases may suffer
                from slower performance in transaction-heavy applications or
                read-intensive operations, especially if the system is not
                optimized with indexes or caching.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Possible Over-Normalization:</strong> Sometimes,
                excessive normalization leads to too many small tables, which
                fragments data excessively. This fragmentation can make the
                system harder to manage and impact performance negatively.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Design Complexity:</strong> Designing a fully normalized
                database requires a good understanding of data dependencies and
                relationships, which can increase the time and effort required
                during the design phase. For newcomers, this can be a steep
                learning curve.

            <h2>Centralized vs Distributed Databases</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              A <strong>centralized database</strong> stores all data at a
              single, central location, usually on one server or mainframe
              computer. This makes management simpler, as all data is controlled
              from one place. In contrast, a
              <strong>distributed database</strong> spreads data across multiple
              physical locations, which could be in different buildings, cities,
              or countries. These distributed sites communicate and coordinate
              to give users the experience of working with a single database
              system.
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Centralized Database:</strong> Because all data resides
                at one place, it is easier to maintain and secure. Backup
                procedures are straightforward, and administrators have full
                control over access and consistency, reducing the chance of
                conflicting data versions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Distributed Database:</strong> Distributed databases
                improve system availability and fault tolerance because data is
                replicated at multiple sites. If one site fails, others can
                continue operating. Users also benefit from faster local access
                to data stored near them, reducing latency.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Centralized Database:</strong> Having a single physical
                point of storage creates a risk—if the central server fails or
                is attacked, the entire system becomes unavailable. Performance
                may degrade for remote users who experience network delays
                accessing the central database.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Distributed Database:</strong> Designing and managing a
                distributed database is complex. Ensuring data consistency
                across sites requires sophisticated synchronization and
                replication mechanisms, which may increase overhead. Security
                policies must be enforced across multiple locations,
                complicating administration.

            <h2>Database Security</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Database security is the practice of protecting the database from
              unauthorized access, misuse, or damage to ensure that data remains
              confidential, accurate, and available only to authorized users. In
              today’s environment, where data breaches and cyberattacks are
              common, implementing strong database security measures is
              critical.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Preventing hackers or
                internal users without permissions from reading or modifying
                sensitive data is a key challenge.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Confidentiality and Privacy:</strong> Certain data,
                such as personal information, financial details, or trade
                secrets, must be protected to comply with legal regulations and
                maintain user trust.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Protection Against Cyberattacks:</strong> Databases must
                be safeguarded against threats like SQL injection attacks,
                malware infections, and ransomware.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Effective Access Control:</strong> Properly defining who
                can access what data, when, and under what conditions is complex
                in large organizations with many users and roles.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying the identity of users
                before they can access the database through passwords,
                multi-factor authentication, or biometric verification.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Authorization:</strong> Granting or restricting user
                permissions to access specific data or perform certain actions
                based on their roles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Encryption:</strong> Encoding data stored in the
                database or transmitted over the network to protect it from
                interception or theft.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Keeping detailed logs of all
                database activities helps detect unauthorized actions and
                supports forensic analysis if a breach occurs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Firewalls and Intrusion Detection:</strong> External
                protections prevent unauthorized network access to the database
                server.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Role of the Database Administrator (DBA)</h3>
            <p>
              The DBA plays a crucial role in ensuring database security by
              managing user accounts, defining access permissions, and enforcing
              security policies. They monitor database activity for suspicious
              behavior and perform regular backups to safeguard data.
              Additionally, DBAs apply security patches and software updates to
              fix vulnerabilities and comply with regulatory standards.

            <h2>Practical Topics: DDL and DML Languages</h2>
            <h3>Data Definition Language (DDL)</h3>
            <p>
              DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of
              database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. These
              commands affect the schema or structure rather than the data
              itself. For example, the <code>CREATE</code> command allows you to
              create new tables or databases; <code>ALTER</code> lets you modify
              existing table structures, such as adding or deleting columns; and
              <code>DROP</code> deletes tables or other objects entirely.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h3>
            <p>
              DML commands are focused on managing the actual data stored within
              database tables. These include <code>SELECT</code> to retrieve
              data based on specific criteria, <code>INSERT</code> to add new
              rows of data, <code>UPDATE</code> to modify existing data, and
              <code>DELETE</code> to remove data. DML commands are essential for
              day-to-day database operations and interact with the content
              stored within the database.

            <h2>SQL Data Types</h2>
            <div class="datatype">
              <h4>CHAR</h4>
              <p>
                The CHAR data type is used to store fixed-length character
                strings. When you define a CHAR column, you specify its length,
                and the system always reserves that exact amount of space. If
                the stored string is shorter, the remaining space is padded with
                blanks. This makes CHAR efficient for storing data where the
                length is consistent, such as country codes or fixed-format
                identifiers.
              </p>

            <div class="datatype">
              <h4>VARCHAR</h4>
              <p>
                VARCHAR stores variable-length character strings, which means it
                only uses as much space as the actual string requires, plus a
                small amount of overhead. This is more space-efficient than CHAR
                when storing strings of varying lengths, such as names or
                addresses. The maximum length must be defined when creating the
                column.

                BINARY is similar to CHAR but stores fixed-length binary data
                instead of characters. This is useful for storing data like
                images or encrypted information where exact binary
                representation must be preserved.

            <div class="datatype">
              <h4>VARBINARY</h4>
              <p>
                VARBINARY stores variable-length binary data. It works like
                VARCHAR but for binary files or data streams. This allows for
                efficient storage when the size of the binary data varies.

                TEXT is intended for larger amounts of textual data, such as
                descriptions, articles, or notes. It can store up to 65,535
                characters and is useful when you expect more extended content

                ENUM defines a string column that can only take one value from a
                predefined list of allowed values. This ensures data integrity
                by restricting input to specific options, such as 'Male' or

              <p>
                DECIMAL (or NUMERIC) is a fixed-point numeric type that stores
                exact decimal numbers with a defined precision and scale. It is
                often used for financial data where precise decimal
                representation is required to avoid rounding errors.

            <h3>What is a Database?</h3>
            <p>
              A Database is an organized collection of data
              that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores data
              in a structured format, usually in tables, for efficient retrieval
              and manipulation.

  <div id="answer" class="answer">
    <h3>What is a Relational Database?</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>Relational Database</strong> is a type of database that stores data in the form of tables (also called relations). Each table consists of rows and columns, where rows represent records and columns represent attributes. It uses keys (like primary and foreign keys) to maintain relationships between tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relational model was introduced by E. F. Codd and is widely used in modern DBMS systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

    <h2>What is data redundancy? How does DBMS help in reducing it? Explain.</h2>


  <div id="answer" class="answer">
    <h3>What is Data Redundancy?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Data redundancy</strong> refers to the unnecessary repetition or duplication of data in a database or data storage system. It occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places, which can lead to inconsistencies, wasted storage space, and difficulties in data management.
    </p>

    <h3>How Does DBMS Help Reduce Data Redundancy?</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>Database Management System (DBMS)</strong> helps in reducing data redundancy by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Centralizing data storage, so data is stored only once and accessed by multiple applications.</li>
      <li>Using relational models that support normalization — a process that removes duplicate data by organizing it into related tables.</li>
      <li>Allowing relationships between tables using keys (e.g., foreign keys) instead of repeating data.</li>
      <li>Maintaining data consistency through constraints and rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a result, DBMS ensures efficient storage, minimizes duplication, and maintains data accuracy across the system.

    <h2>Define normalization. Explain 1NF, 2NF and 3NF with suitable examples. Explain the normalization process with examples.</h2>


<div id="answer" class="answer">
    <h3>Definition of Normalization</h3>
    <p>
        Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them according to rules called normal forms.
    </p>

    <h3>Normal Forms</h3>

    <h4>First Normal Form (1NF)</h4>
    <p>A table is in 1NF if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values</li>
        <li>There are no repeating groups or arrays</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: Consider the following table storing student information with subjects:</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>StudentID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Subjects</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S007</td>
            <td>Ichigo</td>
            <td>AI, Robotics</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S008</td>
            <td>Luffy</td>
            <td>Cybersecurity</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This table is not in 1NF because the Subjects column has multiple values.</p>

    <p>After applying 1NF:</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>StudentID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Subject</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S007</td>
            <td>Ichigo</td>
            <td>AI</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S007</td>
            <td>Ichigo</td>
            <td>Robotics</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S008</td>
            <td>Luffy</td>
            <td>Cybersecurity</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Second Normal Form (2NF)</h4>
    <p>A table is in 2NF if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is already in 1NF</li>
        <li>All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key</li>
        <li>There is no partial dependency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: Consider a table storing course registrations:</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>StudentID</th>
            <th>CourseID</th>
            <th>StudentName</th>
            <th>CourseName</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S007</td>
            <td>C101</td>
            <td>Ichigo</td>
            <td>Matrix Algebra</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S008</td>
            <td>C202</td>
            <td>Luffy</td>
            <td>Cyber Defense</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This has partial dependencies (StudentName depends only on StudentID, CourseName depends only on CourseID).</p>

    <p>After applying 2NF:</p>

    <table border="1">
        <caption>Students</caption>
        <tr>

            <td>S008</td>
            <td>Luffy</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <table border="1">
        <caption>Registrations</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>StudentID</th>
            <th>CourseID</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S007</td>
            <td>C101</td>

        <tr>
            <td>S008</td>
            <td>C202</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Third Normal Form (3NF)</h4>
    <p>A table is in 3NF if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is already in 2NF</li>
        <li>There is no transitive dependency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: Consider a table storing student details:</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>StudentID</th>
            <th>StudentName</th>
            <th>Department</th>
            <th>DepartmentHead</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>S007</td>
            <td>Ichigo</td>
            <td>Computer Science</td>
            <td>Dr. Kaushal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Information Security</td>
            <td>Dr. Siddhu</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>DepartmentHead depends on Department (transitive dependency).</p>

    <p>After applying 3NF:</p>

    <h3>Primary Key</h3>
    <p>A primary key is a fundamental concept in database design that serves as the unique identifier for each record in a table. It must satisfy these properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Uniqueness:</b> No two rows can have the same primary key value</li>
        <li><b>Non-nullability:</b> The primary key cannot contain NULL values</li>
        <li><b>Stability:</b> The value should ideally remain constant over time</li>

    </table>

    <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
    <p>A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. It enforces referential integrity, ensuring that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You cannot create a record with a foreign key that doesn't exist in the referenced table</li>
        <li>You cannot delete a record that is referenced by a foreign key (unless using cascade operations)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: In the same university database, the <code>Course_Registrations</code> table would use <code>student_id</code> as a foreign key:</p>
    
    <table border="1">
        <caption>Course_Registrations Table</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>registration_id</th>
            <th>student_id</th>
            <th>course_code</th>
            <th>semester</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>REG1001</td>
            <td>STU2023001</td>
            <td>CS101</td>
            <td>Fall 2023</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>REG1002</td>
            <td>STU2023002</td>
            <td>MATH202</td>
            <td>Fall 2023</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Candidate Key</h3>
    <p>A candidate key is any column or combination of columns that could serve as a primary key. All candidate keys must satisfy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uniqueness (no duplicate values)</li>
        <li>Irreducibility (no subset of the columns can uniquely identify rows)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: In an <code>Employees</code> table, multiple attributes might qualify as candidate keys:</p>
    
    <table border="1">
        <caption>Employees Table</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>employee_id</th>
            <th>national_id</th>
            <th>company_email</th>
            <th>full_name</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EMP001</td>
            <td>NID12345678</td>
            <td>alex.j@company.com</td>
            <td>Alex Johnson</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>EMP002</td>
            <td>NID87654321</td>
            <td>maria.g@company.com</td>
            <td>Maria Garcia</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Here, <code>employee_id</code>, <code>national_id</code>, and <code>company_email</code> are all candidate keys.</p>

    <h3>Key Comparison</h3>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Key Type</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Characteristics</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Primary Key</td>
            <td>Main unique identifier</td>
            <td>Unique, not null, immutable</td>
            <td>student_id in Students</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Foreign Key</td>
            <td>Establish relationships</td>
            <td>References primary key, can be null</td>
            <td>student_id in Registrations</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Candidate Key</td>
            <td>Potential unique identifiers</td>
            <td>Unique, irreducible, one becomes primary</td>
            <td>email, national_id in Employees</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary keys are often auto-incrementing integers or UUIDs for simplicity</li>
        <li>Foreign keys create parent-child relationships between tables</li>
        <li>Choosing the right primary key from candidate keys affects database performance</li>
        <li>Composite keys (multiple columns) can be used when single columns aren't unique</li>
    </ul>

<div id="answer" class="answer">
    <h3>What is SQL?</h3>
    <p>
        SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It enables users to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create, modify, and delete database structures</li>
        <li>Insert, update, and retrieve data</li>
        <li>Control access to data</li>
        <li>Ensure data integrity and security</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SQL is declarative - users specify what data they want rather than how to retrieve it.</p>

    <h3>Major Components of SQL</h3>
    
    <h4>1. Data Definition Language (DDL)</h4>
    <p>Commands that define the database structure:</p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Command</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CREATE</td>
            <td>Creates database objects</td>
            <td><code>CREATE TABLE Employees (id INT, name VARCHAR(100));</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ALTER</td>
            <td>Modifies database objects</td>
            <td><code>ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255);</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DROP</td>
            <td>Deletes database objects</td>
            <td><code>DROP TABLE Employees;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>TRUNCATE</td>
            <td>Removes all records from a table</td>
            <td><code>TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;</code></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h4>
    <p>Commands for managing data within tables:</p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Command</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SELECT</td>
            <td>Retrieves data from database</td>
            <td><code>SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department = 'IT';</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>INSERT</td>
            <td>Adds new records</td>
            <td><code>INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (1, 'John Doe');</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>UPDATE</td>
            <td>Modifies existing records</td>
            <td><code>UPDATE Employees SET salary = 75000 WHERE id = 101;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DELETE</td>
            <td>Removes records</td>
            <td><code>DELETE FROM Employees WHERE id = 102;</code></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
  <h3>Common SQL Functions</h3>
    
    <h4>1. Aggregate Functions</h4>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Function</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>COUNT()</td>
            <td>Counts rows</td>
            <td><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SUM()</td>
            <td>Calculates sum</td>
            <td><code>SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>AVG()</td>
            <td>Calculates average</td>
            <td><code>SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MAX()</td>
            <td>Finds maximum value</td>
            <td><code>SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MIN()</td>
            <td>Finds minimum value</td>
            <td><code>SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees;</code></td>
        </tr>
