          <h2>What is Data?</h2>
          <p>
            Data consists of raw, unprocessed facts, figures, or symbols
            collected from various sources. It represents values or observations
            that, in isolation, may lack meaning.
          </p>
          <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> A series of numbers such as
            <code>85, 90, 78</code> representing student scores before any
            analysis.

        <section id="information">
          <h2>What is Information?</h2>
          <p>
            Information is data that has been processed, organized, or
            structured to provide context and meaning. It transforms raw data
            into a useful and interpretable form that supports decision-making.
          </p>
          <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Calculating "The average score of the
            class is 84.3" provides insight derived from the raw student scores.

          <h2>Types of Database Models</h2>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The Hierarchical Model organizes data in a tree-like structure,
              where each record has a single parent and possibly many children.
              It mimics a hierarchy, such as folders within a file system. The
              topmost node is called the root, and subsequent levels are child
              nodes. This model is efficient for operations with predictable
              parent-child relationships. However, it lacks flexibility for
              representing many-to-many relationships and requires traversal
              from the root to access any data.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Network Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The Network Model extends the hierarchical model by allowing each
              child to have multiple parents. It uses a graph structure with
              records connected through links. This model supports complex
              relationships like many-to-many, improving data access speed.
              However, it also increases design complexity and is less intuitive
              to implement compared to newer models.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Relational Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The Relational Model is the most widely used model. It stores data
              in tables (relations), where each table consists of rows (records)
              and columns (attributes). Relationships between tables are
              established using keys such as primary keys and foreign keys. This
              model is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and support for
              powerful querying through SQL. It promotes data integrity and
              reduces redundancy through normalization.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              The ER Model is a high-level conceptual data model used primarily
              in database design. It represents real-world entities (such as
              students, courses) and their relationships (enrollment,
              registration). Entities have attributes (e.g., student name, ID),
              and relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.
              It helps in visualizing data before converting it into relational
              schemas.

            <strong>Referential Integrity:</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              Ensures consistency among rows in related tables. A foreign key in
              one table must match a primary key in another table or be null.

          <h2>Normalization</h2>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Normalization is a systematic approach to organizing data in a
            database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It
            involves dividing large tables into smaller, related ones and
            defining relationships using keys.
          </p>

          <h3>Normal Forms</h3>
          <div class="question">
            <strong>First Normal Form (1NF):</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              A table is in 1NF if:
              <ul>
                <li>All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values.</li>
                <li>Each record is unique and identified by a primary key.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <strong>Second Normal Form (2NF):</strong>
            <div class="answer">
              Achieved when:
              <ul>
                <li>The table is in 1NF.</li>
                <li>
                  All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire
                  primary key (i.e., no partial dependencies).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

                <li>
                  There are no transitive dependencies (i.e., non-key attributes

          <section id="advantages-normalization">
            <h3>Advantages of Normalization</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reduction of Data Redundancy:</strong> Normalization
                helps eliminate duplicate data within the database by organizing
                tables such that each fact is stored only once. This reduces the
                amount of storage required and minimizes inconsistencies that
                arise when the same data is updated in multiple places.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved Data Integrity:</strong> By enforcing
                relationships through keys and dependencies, normalization
                ensures that the data remains accurate and consistent. For
                example, updating a value in one place automatically reflects
                correctly across all related tables.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Easier Database Maintenance:</strong> Since data is
                well-structured and logically organized, it becomes easier for
                database administrators and developers to maintain and update
                the database. Changes to the database schema or data itself are
                less error-prone and simpler to implement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Efficient Storage Utilization:</strong> Normalized
                databases minimize wasted space by avoiding unnecessary
                repetition of data. This leads to more efficient use of disk
                space and can improve overall system performance.

                <strong>Avoidance of Anomalies:</strong> Normalization helps
                prevent common data anomalies such as insertion anomalies (where
                you cannot insert data due to missing related data), update
                anomalies (where some data gets updated but other copies remain
                outdated), and deletion anomalies (where deleting data
                unintentionally removes important related data).

            <h3>Disadvantages of Normalization</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Complex Queries:</strong> Highly normalized databases
                often require joining many tables to retrieve related data,
                which can make queries more complex and harder to write or
                understand. This can slow down the development process for
                complex reports or data retrieval.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance Overhead:</strong> Because of the need for
                multiple joins between tables, normalized databases may suffer
                from slower performance in transaction-heavy applications or
                read-intensive operations, especially if the system is not
                optimized with indexes or caching.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Possible Over-Normalization:</strong> Sometimes,
                excessive normalization leads to too many small tables, which
                fragments data excessively. This fragmentation can make the
                system harder to manage and impact performance negatively.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Design Complexity:</strong> Designing a fully normalized
                database requires a good understanding of data dependencies and
                relationships, which can increase the time and effort required
                during the design phase. For newcomers, this can be a steep
                learning curve.

            <h2>Centralized vs Distributed Databases</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              A <strong>centralized database</strong> stores all data at a
              single, central location, usually on one server or mainframe
              computer. This makes management simpler, as all data is controlled
              from one place. In contrast, a
              <strong>distributed database</strong> spreads data across multiple
              physical locations, which could be in different buildings, cities,
              or countries. These distributed sites communicate and coordinate
              to give users the experience of working with a single database
              system.
            </p>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Centralized Database:</strong> Because all data resides
                at one place, it is easier to maintain and secure. Backup
                procedures are straightforward, and administrators have full
                control over access and consistency, reducing the chance of
                conflicting data versions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Distributed Database:</strong> Distributed databases
                improve system availability and fault tolerance because data is
                replicated at multiple sites. If one site fails, others can
                continue operating. Users also benefit from faster local access
                to data stored near them, reducing latency.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Centralized Database:</strong> Having a single physical
                point of storage creates a risk—if the central server fails or
                is attacked, the entire system becomes unavailable. Performance
                may degrade for remote users who experience network delays
                accessing the central database.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Distributed Database:</strong> Designing and managing a
                distributed database is complex. Ensuring data consistency
                across sites requires sophisticated synchronization and
                replication mechanisms, which may increase overhead. Security
                policies must be enforced across multiple locations,
                complicating administration.

            <h2>Database Security</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Database security is the practice of protecting the database from
              unauthorized access, misuse, or damage to ensure that data remains
              confidential, accurate, and available only to authorized users. In
              today’s environment, where data breaches and cyberattacks are
              common, implementing strong database security measures is
              critical.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Preventing hackers or
                internal users without permissions from reading or modifying
                sensitive data is a key challenge.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Confidentiality and Privacy:</strong> Certain data,
                such as personal information, financial details, or trade
                secrets, must be protected to comply with legal regulations and
                maintain user trust.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Protection Against Cyberattacks:</strong> Databases must
                be safeguarded against threats like SQL injection attacks,
                malware infections, and ransomware.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Effective Access Control:</strong> Properly defining who
                can access what data, when, and under what conditions is complex
                in large organizations with many users and roles.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying the identity of users
                before they can access the database through passwords,
                multi-factor authentication, or biometric verification.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Authorization:</strong> Granting or restricting user
                permissions to access specific data or perform certain actions
                based on their roles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Encryption:</strong> Encoding data stored in the
                database or transmitted over the network to protect it from
                interception or theft.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Keeping detailed logs of all
                database activities helps detect unauthorized actions and
                supports forensic analysis if a breach occurs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Firewalls and Intrusion Detection:</strong> External
                protections prevent unauthorized network access to the database
                server.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Role of the Database Administrator (DBA)</h3>
            <p>
              The DBA plays a crucial role in ensuring database security by
              managing user accounts, defining access permissions, and enforcing
              security policies. They monitor database activity for suspicious
              behavior and perform regular backups to safeguard data.
              Additionally, DBAs apply security patches and software updates to
              fix vulnerabilities and comply with regulatory standards.

            <h2>Practical Topics: DDL and DML Languages</h2>
            <h3>Data Definition Language (DDL)</h3>
            <p>
              DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of
              database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. These
              commands affect the schema or structure rather than the data
              itself. For example, the <code>CREATE</code> command allows you to
              create new tables or databases; <code>ALTER</code> lets you modify
              existing table structures, such as adding or deleting columns; and
              <code>DROP</code> deletes tables or other objects entirely.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</h3>
            <p>
              DML commands are focused on managing the actual data stored within
              database tables. These include <code>SELECT</code> to retrieve
              data based on specific criteria, <code>INSERT</code> to add new
              rows of data, <code>UPDATE</code> to modify existing data, and
              <code>DELETE</code> to remove data. DML commands are essential for
              day-to-day database operations and interact with the content
              stored within the database.

            <h2>SQL Data Types</h2>
            <div class="datatype">
              <h4>CHAR</h4>
              <p>
                The CHAR data type is used to store fixed-length character
                strings. When you define a CHAR column, you specify its length,
                and the system always reserves that exact amount of space. If
                the stored string is shorter, the remaining space is padded with
                blanks. This makes CHAR efficient for storing data where the
                length is consistent, such as country codes or fixed-format
                identifiers.
              </p>

            <div class="datatype">
              <h4>VARCHAR</h4>
              <p>
                VARCHAR stores variable-length character strings, which means it
                only uses as much space as the actual string requires, plus a
                small amount of overhead. This is more space-efficient than CHAR
                when storing strings of varying lengths, such as names or
                addresses. The maximum length must be defined when creating the
                column.

                BINARY is similar to CHAR but stores fixed-length binary data
                instead of characters. This is useful for storing data like
                images or encrypted information where exact binary
                representation must be preserved.

            <div class="datatype">
              <h4>VARBINARY</h4>
              <p>
                VARBINARY stores variable-length binary data. It works like
                VARCHAR but for binary files or data streams. This allows for
                efficient storage when the size of the binary data varies.

                TEXT is intended for larger amounts of textual data, such as
                descriptions, articles, or notes. It can store up to 65,535
                characters and is useful when you expect more extended content

                decimal numbers using floating-point representation. FLOAT uses
                less storage but less precision, while DOUBLE uses more storage
                and provides higher precision. They are useful when exact
